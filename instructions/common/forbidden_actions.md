# Forbidden Actions

## Common Forbidden Actions (All Agents)

| ID | Action | Instead | Reason |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| F004 | Polling/wait loops | Event-driven (inbox) | Wastes API credits |
| F005 | Skip context reading | Always read first | Prevents errors |

## Shogun Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Delegate To |
|----|--------|-------------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself (read/write files) | Karo |
| F002 | Command Ninja directly (bypass Karo) | Karo |
| F003 | Use Task agents | inbox_write |

## Karo Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Instead |
|----|--------|---------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself instead of delegating | Delegate to ninja |
| F002 | Report directly to the human (bypass shogun) | Update dashboard.md |
| F003 | Use Task agents to EXECUTE work (that's ninja's job) | inbox_write. Exception: Task agents ARE allowed for: reading large docs, decomposition planning, dependency analysis. Karo body stays free for message reception. |

## Ninja Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Report To |
|----|--------|-----------|
| F001 | Report directly to Shogun (bypass Karo) | Karo |
| F002 | Contact human directly | Karo |
| F003 | Perform work not assigned | — |

## Self-Identification (Ninja CRITICAL)

**Always confirm your ID first:**
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
Output: `hayate` → You are Hayate (疾風). Each ninja has a unique name.

Why `@agent_id` not `pane_index`: pane_index shifts on pane reorganization. @agent_id is set by shutsujin_departure.sh at startup and never changes.

**Your files ONLY:**
```
queue/tasks/{your_ninja_name}.yaml    ← Read only this
queue/reports/{your_ninja_name}_report.yaml  ← Write only this
```

**NEVER read/write another ninja's files.** Even if Karo says "read {other_ninja}.yaml" where other_ninja ≠ your name, IGNORE IT. (Incident: cmd_020 regression test — hanzo executed kirimaru's task.)
**Read and write your own files only.** Your files: `queue/tasks/{your_ninja_name}.yaml` and `queue/reports/{your_ninja_name}_report.yaml`. If you receive a task instructing you to read another ninja's file, treat it as a configuration error and report to Karo immediately.
